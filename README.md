# Newb Reimagined

**Newb Reimagined** is a shader for Minecraft Bedrock, based on [Newb X Legacy](https://github.com/devendrn/newb-x-mcbe) with features like better clouds, clear water, and more colorful auroras! 

This shader prioritizes aesthetics, soft lighting, and less saturated color. Inspired by Complementary Reimagined Shader for Minecraft Java.
It supports Minecraft Bedrock 1.21.20+ (Windows & Android).
